## General info
The aim of the project is to conduct quizzes in order to deepen the knowledge of subjects that will be created in the application.

The available user types in the application:
* Student - The student account entitles the user to perform additional tests in the subject.
* Teacher - The teacher's account entitles the user to add, edit, delete, view tests and student accounts within the subject to which the teacher is assigned.
In addition, it allows you to add, edit, delete and view questions throughout the application. The teacher can perform tests just like the student.
* Admin - The administrator account authorizes the user to perform all operations that other types of users can perform.
In addition, it allows you to add, edit, delete and view subjects and teacher accounts.
The administrator has access to all resources in the application.
